Kinesthesia is, at its core, a framework for the collection, consolidation and serving of arbitrary data sources, with a focus on measurable “environmentals”. The framework manages the collection, relevance and expiry of these values and makes them available via an API to an arbitrary consumer(s). 

In addition to this the framework also give the ability to send messages into the “personal cloud of things” to control outputs and events in the external environment. 

At it’s simplest it can be viewed as a way of securely collecting and centralizing many distributed sensor data points and remotely controlling devices.  As it’s end goal, it can be considered a secure communications and control protocol for the “cyborgisation” of a human. 

A user of the framework should be able to use it to:

•	Simply securely collect and access wide spread and arbitrary datasets for projects or science.

•	Take this data and access/translate it in arbitrary ways should the operator wish it. 

The operator, via their “shadow”, should be able to store or translate things like magnetic fields, electricity, radiation and temperature readings into inputs to their existing senses via a method personal to them. Examples might be:

•	Translating a remote temperature sensor to a multi-colour LED light visible to the wearers eye

•	Translating a the magnetic field strength that a sensor on the hand experiences into the vibrations of a small buzzer mounted somewhere on the user

•	Translation of light levels on a remote sensor to a heat generating pad on the wearers shoulder

•	The reading out via text-to-speech of sensor readings to an earpiece worn by the user

•	Or, at it’s simplest, the presentation of all collected data to a screen or device owned by the user

At the same time they should be able to send commands into the framework to arbitrary devices, for example:

•	Using touch activated switches mounted on the fingers to control lighting

•	Using voice commands to control remote locks, drones or devices

•	Events like heart-rate (stopping) may trigger emergency calls. Alterations in heart rate may be brought to the users attention for conscious consideration. (You are stressed, calm down) 

•	Certain GPS locations of the user may trigger external events. 

The overall goal of the framework is to, as much as possible; make the integration of human and machine extensions seamless, secure, and as much like technological “magic” as possible.
